## Highlights about the Project 
This is task2 of Andela Capstone projects 
Delivarable was to create a back end API program to link to the frontend site.

The Backend API program is in /backend folder which when installed will run on port 3000
Note: Need to run npm install as the node_modules are excluded from the commit

As for the front end angular app some adjustments were made on the sauces.service.ts for the backend to work smoothly
